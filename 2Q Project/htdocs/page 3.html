        <br> <hr> <br>
        
        <article>
            <p> Panic attacks are a common symptom to mental health disorders. It can be characterized by a extreme fear, the kind that is overwhelming and suffocating. These attacks can be expected or unexpected, may be triggered by a specific stressor (e.g. phobias) or may come unexpectedly, at any given moment. Panic attacks are also accompanied by physical symptoms like a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath,or nausea (Brito, 2019). These attacks last between 5 to 20 minutes, but it can go more or less depending on the severity of the attack (NHS, 2020). These events are scary - someone suffering from a panic attack does not have control over what their body does, but there are ways to deal with them and to get through these experiences. The video below further describes panic attacks, and how to cope with them. </p>

            <h3> Dealing with a panic attack on your own </h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li><p> First, accept and acknowledge the fact that you are going through a panic attack, and educate yourself about the symptoms and causes in order to be more prepared if it happens in the future. </p></li>
                <li><p> Address your fear. When you feel a panic attack approaching, you can talk to yourself and remember that you are going through a mental battle - panic attacks will not kill you and you are not in real danger. Then, psyche yourself up - perform some breathing exercises, and reassure yourself. Below is an illustration of the box breathing technique, and it can help on regulating your breathing, especially during panic attacks when you seem to lose control. </p></li>

                <li><p> Do not distract yourself. It may be tempting to focus your mind elsewhere and somehow fool yourself that you are not panicking, but the healthiest and safest way to deal with an attack is to acknowledge and accept it. Try to not fight the symptoms and let them manifest and remember that they are temporary and would, in fact, pass. </p></li>
                <li><p> Close your eyes. Panic attacks may be caused by some triggers, and if being in an environment with a lot of stimuli may only strengthen your attack. Closing your eyes reduces the stimuli and blocks out possible triggers, and you can then proceed to regulating and focusing on your breathing.   </p></li>
                <li><p> Be mindful of your surroundings. Going through a panic attack makes you lose touch with reality, and a way to go around this is to ground yourself with things in your environment. You can use your physical senses to do this, like feeling the surface around you and feeling the texture of your clothes. These sensations give you something objective to focus on, making it easier for you to "come down" from the attack and orient yourself with reality. Below is an illustration of the 5-4-3-2-1 coping technique, and it is an effective grounding technique for stressful situations. </p></li>

                <li><p> Picture a focus object. During panic attacks, it might be helpful to focus your attention on a single object in order to tune yourself into your environment. For example, focus on a chip in the paint on the wall, and describe its shape, color, texture, and notable things about it. </p></li>
                <li><p> Use muscle relaxation practices. Other than breathing, muscle relaxation can help you be in control of your own body, especially during panic attacks when your body seems to turn on you. You can start with one muscle at a time, like a finger in your hand and work your way up your body. It would also help if you practice this beforehand, preparing yourself to be ready when a panic attack confronts you. </p></li>
                <li><p> Imagine your happy place. A panic attack may be caused by triggers that make you feel negative feeelings (e.g. distress, worry), so try to cancel them out with things that give you positive feelings (e.g. happiness, warmth).  </p></li>

                <h3> Helping someone else get through a panic attack </h3>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><p> Always ask what the person needs. Do not assume anything. People's approach to panic attacks may be different, and there is no textbook plan in helping someone else get through it. Listen to what they want and not want you to do, and respect their wishes. </p></li>
                    <li><p> Stay with the person, and if they wish to be alone, stay within a reasonable distance where they can call you in case they need something. If they let you stay beside them, try to keep them calm by talking to them. Your voice may help ground them to their environment. </p></li>
                    <li><p> If a person usually takes medicines during an attack, stay besidde them and offer them their medications. </p></li>
                    <li><p> Speak in short and understandable sentences. Their attention is divided, and they are tuning themselves to their environment, so make sure that your words are simple and that they do not need to think about it much in order to understand. </p></li>
                    <li><p> Be predictable. Do not do things they might not expect, as it might overwhelm them. </p></li>
                    <li><p> Perform breathing exercises with them. If they seem to be having difficulty regaining control over their breathing, help them by inhaling and exhaling with them so they can imitate you. </p></li>
                    <li><p> Whisper things to them like "You can get through this.", "This will pass.", "Tell me what you need.", and other reassuring phrases. There is no such thing as a "script" in moments like these, so only say those phrases that feel right to you and to the other person. </p></li>
                    <li><p> After the attack, let the person be comfortable with you. Do not force them to get professional help - they must do it in their own pace. Give a listening ear to whatever they have to say, as being heard may help them feel valid. Do not baby them - they are not weak for having these attacks, and talk to them like you would to a normal person. </p></li>
