			<h1 id="title"> Most Common Mental Illnesses </h1>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<p id="intro"> The mind is our safe space - the only thing we do not have to share with other people. In it we can have our opinions, our secrets, our feelings, and everything 
			we can hide or share from the people around us. This is not the case for everyone. The mind is not always a safe space, nor is it always healthy. Some people need 
			escape from their own minds, for it is invaded with illnesses they cannot overcome. However, because most of these illnesses are not physically manifested and thus 
			hard to detect, some people who have them do not even know they do, and so they get swept under the rug as if they do not exist (but they do exist, and over untreated 
			time they might get worse). With this, here are the top nine most common mental illnesses around the world, and their symptoms. </p>
			
			<br>
			
			<br>
			
			<!-- Anxiety Disorder -->
			
			
			<div id="anxiety">
				<h3> Anxiety Disorder </h3>
		
				<p> This mental illness is probably the most common of them all. It might even be more common than you think. According to the World Health 
					Organization (WHO), there are 260 million people around the globe who are diagnosed of anxiety (World Health Organization, 2017). However, because of the subtle symptoms, some people do not even know 
					they have this, and some might think that it is 'normal' and 'just a part of their personality'. However, anxiety disorder is real, it is a disease, and it must be 
					treated because it might get worse. </p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p> Symptoms: </p>	
				<ul>
					<li><p> excessive worrying </p></li>
					<li><p> feeling agitated (rapid heartbeat, sweating, shaking, and dry mouth) </p></li>
					<li><p> restlessness (uncomfortable urge to move, feeling "on edge", inability to stay in one place) </p></li>
					<li><p> fatigue (becoming easily tired) </p></li>
					<li><p> difficulty concentrating </p></li>
					<li><p> irritability </p></li>
					<li><p> tense muscles </p></li>
					<li><p> trouble falling or staying asleep (may also be insomnia) </p></li>
					<li><p> panic attacks (extremely intense fear, difficulty in breathing) </p></li>
					<li><p> avoiding social situations (worrying and being scared of meeting and talking to other people or being embarrassed) </p></li>
					<li><p> irrational fears (extreme fear on something that is not normally or justifiably scary) </p></li>
					<li><p> (Julson, 2018) </li></p>
				</ul>

			<!-- Schizophrenia -->
			
			<div id="schizo">
				<h3 id="idk"> Schizophrenia </h3>
				
				<p> Not only is this troubling and scary, it is dangerous as well. Schizophrenic people may hear or see things that are not actually there (delusions or 
				hallucinations), and these things affect how they act alone or around other people (Step to Health, 2018). Because of these hallucinations and how they affect one's actions, schizophrenic 
				people might noticeably change from day to day. According to WHO, around 20 million people are affected by this disease worldwide (World Health Organization, 2019). </p>
				
				<br>
				
				<p> Symptoms: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><p> delusion </p></li>
					<li><p> hallucinations and illusions </p></li>
					<li><p> agitation </p></li>
					<li><p> disordered thinking </p></li>
					<li><p> inappropriate reactions </p></li>
					<li><p> phobia </p></li>
					<li><p> lack of pleasure or interest in activities </p></li>

			<!-- Phobias -->
			<div id="phobia">
				<h3> Phobias </h3>
				
				<p> Having a fear in something or not being fond of particular stuff is pretty common. However, phobias are not just 'not liking something'. It is the intense 
				fear of a particular subject, and interacting with these things may cause them intense physical reactions (Williams, 2014). A phobia is different from dislike, and the former is 
				defined as an irrational fear that stops a person from living life to the fullest in fear of their phobia interacting with them (Williams, 2014). The manifestation of phobias can 
				vary, but the most common ones are shaking, palpitations, intense fear, and difficulty in breathing. According to WHO, around 21 million adults suffer from at least 
				one phobia (Williams, 2014). </p>
				
				<br>
			
				<p> Most Common Phobias: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><p> Glossophobia - the fear of public speaking. </p></li>
					<li><p> Necrophobia - the fear of death or dying. </p></li>
					<li><p> Arachnophobia - the fear of spiders. </p></li>
					<li><p> Myctophobia - the fear of darkness. </p></li>
					<li><p> Acrophobia - the fear of heights. </p></li>
					<li><p> Sociophobia - the fear of socializing or being in a crowded place. </p></li>
					<li><p> Aerophobia - the fear of flying. </p></li>
					<li><p> Claustrophobia - the fear of confined spaces. </p></li>
					<li><p> Agoraphobia - the fear of being unable to escape an open place. </p></li>
					<li><p> Brontophobia - the fear of thunder and lightning. </p></li>
					<li><p> (Williams, 2014) </p></li>

			<!-- Bipolar Disorder -->
			<div id="bipolar">
			 <h3> Bipolar Disorder </h3>
				
			<p> This disorder is categorized as one of the "mood disorders". It is characterized as intense mood swings, exaggerated changes in emotions, and manic episodes  (Step to Health, 2018). 
			Most of the time, people with bipolar disorders do not have much of support around them, because their episodes can be scary for people who do not understand them. 
			An example is, during their episodes, they can laugh uncontrollably one second and wail in despair the next. This results to people not knowing how to react to these 
			and therefore being confused and scared of the said person. However, (this applies to every mental illness), the least we can do for them is to simply be there, to 
			support and love them through, being there for them both when they want and do not want to talk. It is also estimated that around 46 million people have bipolar 
			disorder (Parekh, 2017). </p>
				
			<br>
				
			<p> Symptoms </p>
			<ul>
				<li><p> extreme happiness, hopefulness, or excitement </p></li>
				<li><p> irritability, anger, or fits of rage </p></li>
				<li><p> restlessness and agitation </p></li>
				<li><p> rapid speech </p></li>
				<li><p> poor concentration and judgment </p></li>
				<li><p> increased energy </p></li>
				<li><p> less need for sleep </p></li>
				<li><p> unusually high sex drive </p></li>
				<li><p> setting unrealistic goals </p></li>
				<li><p> paranoia </p></li>
			</ul>
			<p> Depressive phase may include (following manic episode): </p>
			<ul>
				<li><p> sadness and crying </p></li>
				<li><p> hopelessness, worthlessness, guilt </p></li>
				<li><p> loss of energy </p></li>
				<li><p> loss of interest or pleasure in everyday activities </p></li>
				<li><p> trouble concentrating and making decisions </p></li>
				<li><p> irritability </p></li>
				<li><p> either oversleeping or sleeplessness </p></li>
				<li><p> change in appetite </p></li>
				<li><p> weight loss/gain </p></li>
				<li><p> suicidal thoughts and tendencies </p></li>

			<!-- Obsessive Compulsive Disorder -->
			<div id="ocd">
				<h3> Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) </h3>
				<p> This disorder goes far beyond being a perfectionist and wanting your books to be aligned in a particular pleasing way. A person suffering from OCD may resort to 
				extreme lengths, such as not stepping on lines on the floor, having the urge to adjust everything they see, obsessive organization, and many other things because 
				they feel like if they do not, a consequence will be waiting for them. For them, these actions are unstoppable, and they might 'look weird' and 'act crazy' when they 
				are in public. Around 2.2 million people around the world are affected by OCD. </p>
				
				<br>
				<p> Symptoms </p>
				<ul>
					<li><p> obsessions or compulsions </p></li>
					<li><p> persisting unwanted thoughts </p></li>
					<li><p> irrational fears </p></li>
					<li><p> ritualistic behaviors that 'would' get rid of thoughts </p></li>
					<li><p> (Bonvissuto, n.d.) </p></li>
