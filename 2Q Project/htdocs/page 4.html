            <ul>
                <li><p> A person is not 'weaker than other people' for having mental health illnesses or disorders. You can even say they are stronger than most - they go through every day like 'ordinary' people but with an added struggle. </p></li>
                <li><p> There is no sort of generalization that is accurate for everyone in terms of mental health. The human mind is far too complex to be labelled and put into a box, so do not assume that things that apply to you apply to other people as well. We are all different, and respect that difference. </p></li>
                <li><p> If someone confides in you, do not share their information without permission. This may be basic, but some people still need to be reminded about this. Trust is a very fragile thing, and once it is broken, it would be nearly impossible to replace it. However, if you know someone who is actively harming themselves and endangering their life, consult a trusted adult and ask for advice, because every situation is unique and there are factors you must consider before doing anything. </p></li>

                <li><p> Never force someone to go into therapy. They must seek help in their own, comfortable pace. </p></li>
                <li><p> Never 'out' other people's mental illnesses. Their mental health is their own, and it is theirs to share or to keep. </p></li>
                <li><p> You are valid. Your feelings are valid. No matter what you feel, you must accept and acknowledge it and go on from there. You are not being 'irrational' or 'unreasonable' for your likes, fears, and worries. </p></li>
                <li><p> Meditate. Being alone with your thoughts and being aware of your body may help you confront the challenges that your brain presents to you. </p></li>

                </aside>
                
                <li><p> Take a break. No matter where you are in life, what you are doing, or who you are, you must take a break every once in a while. </p></li>
                <li><p> Never make fun of someone else's rituals or ticks. Again, every one of us is different, and something weird for you maybe be normal or even comfortable for others, so respect that. </p></li>
                <li><p> Be nice to people, or at least do not be unpleasant. It takes no effort to not make someone uncomfortable, and being nice to people may not be much for you, but it might go a long way for other people. </p></li>
                <li><p> Keep an open mind. There are so many things left to learn and find in this world, and keeping your mind open to new ideas and concepts may make you more in tune with the world you are living in. </p></li>

                </aside>
                
                <li><p> Be careful about what you say online or in person. Your words may make or break someone else's perspective of themselves or of other people, and even if you did not mean it, the damage may have been done already. </p></li>
                <li><p> Never decide for other people. They stand for themselves, and even if you are older and has only good intentions, still consult them and ask for their consent in whatever decision you might make in their behalf (in times when they cannot decide for themselves). </p></li>
                <li><p> Check up on your friends, families, and loved ones. Lending a listening ear or a warm hand may help them take on whatever struggle they are facing. Little efforts may go a long way, and showing you care for them and that you are there for them might help them overcome their own problems and conflicts. </p></li>
                <li><p> It is best to consult a physician/psychologist for mental health disorders, but do not shame other people for self-diagnosing. Yes, other conceited people might do it for the attention, but that is not the case for everyone. Some people self-diagnose because of valid reasons like not being able to afford medical help or being in a close-minded environment, but that does not make their condition invalid. </p></li>

                </aside>
                
                <li><p> You are enough. Being a breathing and living human being is an achievement in and of itself. Do things at your own pace, and do not depend your worth on the standards of society. </p></li>
                <li><p> Do not be ashamed of your own condition. It may be hard, at the beginning, because your mind works differently and it is a lot harder to deal with, but that is a part of you and it is not your fault. No matter who you are and what you are facing, you are a magnificent creature and everyone's mind is complex. </p></li>
                <li><p> It gets better. You might hear this a lot of times and you may be sick of it because nothing is changing or things are but for the worse, but all things come to pass. Feeling down is temporary, and as much as every mind is unique, there are an infinite number of things in the world that are worth loving and being happy about. You might not have found the one thing for you, but soon you will, and that's when it gets better.  </p></li>
